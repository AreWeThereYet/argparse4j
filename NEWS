argparse4j 0.2.2
================

Release Note
------------

This release brings several enhancements to the existing features. In
Arg annotation, 'dest' argument is now optional. Also inheritance
chain is queried when searching fields and methods. When dealing with
variable number of positional arguments, the default value is not
overridden with empty list if no argument is given.

Changes
-------

* Only override default for posArgs when there is at least one given.
  - Don't call the action with an empty list if no parameter was given
    for a posArgs with nArgs("*")
  - In case default has not been set, an empty list should be returned
    (ensured by #testParseArgsWithPosargOutOfIndex())
  Patch from Brice Jaglin.

* Included superclasses containing annotations.  Modified the method
  that queries for the Arg annotation so that it also includes the
  fields and methods declared in superclasses.
  Patch from Juan Manuel Caicedo Carvajal.

* Arg annotation - Made the 'dest' argument optional.  The 'dest'
  argument of the Arg annotation now it's optional. The parser will
  use the name of the annotated field or method in case that the
  argument was not provided. Patch from Juan Manuel Caicedo Carvajal.

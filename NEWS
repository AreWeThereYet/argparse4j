argparse4j 0.6.0
================

Release Note
------------

This release fixes the bug that nargs("*") or nargs("+") for
positional argument consume all arguments, and do not left any
arguments to the remaining required positional arguments which take at
least 1 argument.  By the product of this fix, we also fixed the bug
that positional arguments are effectively separated and stop to
consume by the existence of a flag.  For example, we define positional
argument "foo" which has nargs("+"), and optional argument, "-b" which
takes not argument.  Then previously, giving "a -b c d" to the program
resulted error, because "d" was not consumed by "foo".  Now "d" is
identified as one of argument to "foo", and "foo" takes "a" and "d"
correctly.  This could possibly change the behaviour of the
application, depending on how arguments are supplied.

Changes
-------

* Fix bug that positional arguments are separated and not consumed if
  flag exists in between.

* Distribute arguments to positional Argument object to satisfy
  minimum number of arguments.

argparse4j 0.4.0
================

Release Note
------------

This release fixes the bug that argument is processed twice with
concatenated short options.  The following new features were added:
argument/sub-command abbreviations, usage text override, ${prog}
substitution in version text, sub-command aliases and count() action.
If neither title and description are specified to
MutuallyExclusiveGroup, the help message for the group is merged into
other optinal arguments. The Argument.type(Class) now supports
valueOf(String) static method for conversion. It also now supports
enums directly. The behavior of nargs("*") for optional arguments are
slightly changed for some corner-cases. See the changes for details.

Changes
-------

* Show command aliases in help message

* Avoid ``\n`` and use %n or TextHelper.LINESEP instead

* Add CountArgumentAction

  CountArgumentAction counts the number of occurrence of an option.
  Arguments.count() returns the instance of this object for shortcut.

* Support ${prog} substitution in version string

* Add ArgumentParser.usage()

  By default, the program usage is generated from the arguments
  the ArgumentParser object contains. This method overrides it.

* Add ArgumentParser.addMutuallyExclusiveGroup() without title arg

  If both title and description are empty, the help message for the
  group is merged into other optional arguments.

* Don't show available enum constants when conversion failed

  If they are shown, user may be confused with choices because choices
  may be more limited.

* Add ReflectArgumentType

  ReflectArgumentType is an enhanced version of
  ConstructorArgumentType.  It first tries to convert given String to
  desired type using valueOf static method of the type. If it failed,
  use the constructor of given type just like a
  ConstructorArgumentType. Since enums have valueOf static method,
  ReflectArgumentType works with enums as well.  The
  ReflectArgumentType effectively deprecates ConstructorArgumentType
  and EnumArgumentType.

* Throw exception if no nameOrFlags is given

* Support argument/sub-command abbreviations

* Adjust narg("*") handling for optinal arguments

  The optional argument with nargs("*") and without default set is not
  given in command-line, the result is now null instead of empty list.

  The optional argument with nargs("*") is given in command-line with
  emtpy list, the result is now empty list. It will overwrite existing
  value or appened to the existing list in case of append() action.

* Fix bug that argument is processed twice with concatenated short options

argparse4j 0.5.0
================

Release Note
------------

This release fixes the bug that "-" inside positional argument name is
not converted to "_".  We encourage the applications to review about
this change and update their code, but it is not feasible, use
ArgumentParsers.setNoDestConversionForPositionalArgs(true) to tell the
library not to do this conversion.

Changes
-------

* Add partial localization for German

  Patch from schoemer

* Add ArgumentParsers#{get,set}NoDestConversionForPositionalArgs()

  This method was added for applications where migration is not
  feasible.

* Convert dashes (-) to underscores (_) in arg dest for pos args to be
  consistent with options

  Patch from Amr Mostafa
